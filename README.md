# BGM - Bradley Harms' bass.dll extension for legacy Game Maker
This is a reupload of the available contents from [the last working archive of the original owner's site](https://web.archive.org/web/20100506143504/http://www.Alphaios.net/bgm). 
Binary checking shows this is the same release Cactus used for several of his games including 'Burn The Trash!', which suffers from issues running on newer Windows systems.

Regarding license status, here's the authors words taken from his and included readme in the archives:
> Permission to use BGM is given to you only under the following conditions:
> * You may not use BGM in any commercial product. It is provided for use in free software ONLY. Shareware, “trialware”, etc. are also not allowed.
> * As BGM uses BASS.DLL, you must agree to the terms of it's "license", which is at the end of this document.
> * It is requested, but not required, that if you use BGM in your project you will place a link to the BGM web page ( http://alphaios.net/bgm ) in the credits of your project.

> BASS 2.3 - Copyright (c) 1999-2006, Ian Luck. All rights reserved.
> BGM 2.0 - Copyright (c) 2005-2006, Bradley Harms.

Being an extension for the BASS sound system, the conditions of BASS itself referenced [at it's original site](https://www.un4seen.com/) also apply.
